1. Executive Summary
This project built an Automated Risk Register which ingests raw vulnerability output from Greenbone Vulnerability Manager (GVM) and transforms it into a prioritized list of business risks. We created a realistic enterprise asset inventory, executed vulnerability scanning in an isolated virtual lab (Kali Purple and Metasploitable 2), and implemented a Python engine to parse XML findings, map them to assets, compute risk scores using a defensible CVSS-to-likelihood conversion, and produce a final risk register sorted by priority.

2. Team Process & Workflow
Our team used a SOC-like workflow:
- Environment: VirtualBox host-only network containing Kali Purple (scanner) and Metasploitable 2 (target).
- Roles:
  - Shaik Toufiq — Python developer and risk scoring architecture.
  - Sai Sindhu Javvaji — GVM operator and scanner task configuration.
  - Sai Bindu Javvaji — documentation and final report generation.
  - Sadia — asset inventory and data validation.
  - Hunter — GitHub manager and QA.
- Version control: All code and artifacts were maintained in a private GitHub repository with feature branches and a final tag `v1.0-final`.

3. CVSS → Likelihood Mapping (and justification)
We used the following mapping:
- CVSS 7.0–10.0 -> Likelihood 5 (High exploitation probability + severe impact)
- CVSS 4.0–6.9 -> Likelihood 3 (Moderate exploitation probability)
- CVSS 0.1–3.9 -> Likelihood 1 (Low exploitation probability or minor misconfiguration)

Justification: CVSS provides severity; however, organizations require a simplified likelihood scale for prioritization. The mapping above balances severity with realistic exploitation likelihood and is easily defensible to stakeholders.

4. LLM Prompt (optional bonus)
We used an LLM prompt to generate business-friendly threat scenarios:
"You are a cybersecurity analyst briefing an executive. Explain the real-world business risk of the following vulnerability in one simple sentence."

5. Top 3 Risks (analysis)
From the generated risk_register.csv, the top three risks were:
1) VSFTPD 2.3.4 Backdoor — Risk Score 25
   - Impact: Full root compromise. Business risk: immediate system takeover, data exfiltration and persistence.
   - Recommended action: Isolate host, remove/upgrade VSFTPD, reimage if persistence is suspected.

2) OpenSSH Remote Code Execution — Risk Score 25
   - Impact: Remote arbitrary code execution via SSH. Business risk: lateral movement, credential theft.
   - Recommended action: Patch or replace OpenSSH, rotate SSH keys, restrict access via firewall.

3) Apache Directory Traversal — Risk Score 25
   - Impact: Exploitable directory traversal allows reading system files and configurations.
   - Recommended action: Patch Apache and fix application input validation; restrict file permissions.

6. Reflection: Automated vs Manual Day Zero Analysis
Our manual Day Zero exercise identified a handful of obvious issues. The automated pipeline:
- Found significantly more vulnerabilities
- Produced objective scores and a prioritized list
- Reduced manual analysis time and human bias
- Improved traceability: every result links to an IP and asset in assets.csv

Automation complements human analysis — it surfaces scale and repeatability, while analysts interpret business impact and plan remediation.

7. Deliverables
- assets.csv (enterprise inventory)
- gvm_report.xml (exported from GVM) or the provided realistic XML sample
- main.py (parser + risk engine)
- risk_register.csv (final prioritized list)
- CONTRIBUTORS.md
- Briefing report (this document)
